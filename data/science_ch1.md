# CHAPTER 1

Chemical Reactions and Equations

Consider the following situations of daily life and think what happens
when –
- milk is left at room temperature during summers.
- an iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere.
- grapes get fermented.
- food is cooked.
- food gets digested in our body.
- we respire.

In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial
substance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical
and chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical
change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.

You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a
chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction
has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to
these questions.

## Activity 1.1

CAUTION: This Activity needs
the teacher's assistance. It
would be better if students
wear suitable eyeglasses.

- Clean a magnesium ribbon
about 3-4 cm long by rubbing
it with sandpaper.
- Hold it with a pair of tongs.
Burn it using a spirit lamp or
burner and collect the ash so
formed in a watch-glass as
shown in Fig. 1.1. Burn  the
magnesium ribbon keeping it
away as far as possible from
your eyes.
- What do you observe?

"Facts are not science — as the dictionary is not literature."
Martin H. Fischer

## Activity 1.2

- Take a few zinc granules in a conical flask or a test tube.
- Add dilute hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid to this
(Fig. 1.2).

CAUTION: Handle the acid with care.

- Do you observe anything happening around the zinc
granules?
- Touch the conical flask or test tube. Is there any change in
its temperature?

## Activity 1.3

- Take lead nitrate
solution in a test
tube.
- Add potassium
iodide solution
to this.
- What do you
observe?

From the above three activities, we can say that any of
the following observations helps us to determine whether
a chemical reaction has taken place –
- change in state
- change in colour
- evolution of a gas
- change in temperature.

As we observe the changes around us, we can see
that there is a large variety of chemical reactions taking
place around us. We will study about the various types
of chemical reactions and their symbolic representation
in this Chapter.

## 1.1 CHEMICAL EQUATIONS

Activity 1.1 can be described as – when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in
oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a
chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a
shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a
word-equation.

The word-equation for the above reaction would be –

Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide (1.1)
(Reactants)            (Product)

The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),
magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is
magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.

A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an
arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand
side (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are
written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.
The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of
the reaction.

You must have observed that magnesium ribbon burns with a
dazzling white flame and changes into a white powder. This powder is
magnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium
and oxygen present in the air.

### 1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation

Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?
Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use
chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a
chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and
magnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –

Mg + O2 → MgO (1.2)

Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the
LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the
same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,
then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on
both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal
chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical
equation for the burning of magnesium in air.

### 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations

Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass
can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the
total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction
has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.

In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the
same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a
skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us
learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.

The word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –

Zinc + Sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen

The above word-equation may be represented by the following
chemical equation –

Zn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2 (1.3)

Let us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both
sides of the arrow.

Element | Number of atoms in reactants (LHS) | Number of atoms in products (RHS)
--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------
Zn      | 1                                 | 1
H       | 2                                 | 2
S       | 1                                 | 1
O       | 4                                 | 4

As the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of
the arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.

Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –

Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2 (1.4)

**Step I**: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each
formula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the
equation.

Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2 (1.5)

**Step II**: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the
unbalanced equation (1.5).

Element | Number of atoms in reactants (LHS) | Number of atoms in products (RHS)
--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------
Fe      | 1                                 | 3
H       | 2                                 | 2
O       | 1                                 | 4

To equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we
cannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the
reactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient
'4' as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation
becomes –

Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2

**Step III**: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound
that contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a
product. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum
number of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element
oxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on
the LHS.

To balance the oxygen atoms –

The equation would be –

Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + H2 (1.6)
(partly balanced equation)

Atoms of oxygen | In reactants | In products
----------------|--------------|------------
(i) Initial      | 1 (in H2O)   | 4 (in Fe3O4)
(ii) To balance  | 1×4          | 4

**Step IV**: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements
to proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced
equation.

To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules
of hydrogen as four on the RHS.

Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2 (1.7)
(partly balanced equation)

Atoms of hydrogen | In reactants | In products
-------------------|--------------|------------
(i) Initial         | 8 (in 4 H2O) | 2 (in H2)
(ii) To balance     | 8            | 2 × 4

**Step V**: Examine the above equation and pick up the third element
which is not balanced. You find that only one element is left to be
balanced, that is, iron.

To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.

3 Fe + 4 H2O → Fe3O4 + 4 H2 (1.8)

Atoms of iron | In reactants | In products
--------------|--------------|------------
(i) Initial    | 1 (in Fe)    | 3 (in Fe3O4)
(ii) To balance| 1×3          | 3

**Step VI**: Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we
count atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.

3Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 + 4H2 (1.9)
(balanced equation)

The numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are
equal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical
equations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance
the equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.

**Step VII**: Writing Symbols of Physical States Carefully examine
the above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about
the physical state of each reactant and product? No information has
been given in this equation about their physical states.

To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states
of the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical
formulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants
and products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),
respectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product
is present as a solution in water.

The balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes

3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g) (1.10)

Note that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this
reaction water is used in the form of steam.

Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless
it is necessary to specify them.

Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,
catalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow
in the equation. For example –

$$
CO(g) + 2H_2(g) \xrightarrow[]{340atm} CH_3OH(l)
$$
(1.11)

$$
6CO_2(aq) + 12H_2O(l) \xrightarrow[\text{Chlorophyll}]{\text{Sunlight}} C_6H_{12}O_6(aq) + 6O_2(aq) + 6H_2O(l)
$$
(1.12)
(Glucose)

Using these steps, can you balance Eq. (1.2) given in the text earlier?

        water.

## 1.2 TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS

We have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one
element do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms
disappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical
reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to
produce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed
between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.

### 1.2.1 Combination Reaction

## Activity 1.4

- Take a small amount of calcium oxide
or quick lime in a beaker.
- Slowly add water to this.
- Touch the beaker as shown in Fig. 1.3.
- Do you feel any change in temperature?

Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime
(calcium hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat.

CaO(s) + H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + Heat (1.13)
(Quick lime)      (Slaked lime)

In this reaction, calcium oxide and water combine to form a single
product, calcium hydroxide. Such a reaction in which a single product
is formed from two or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.

Let us discuss some more examples of combination reactions.

(i) Burning of coal
    C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) (1.15)

(ii) Formation of water from H2(g) and O2(g)
    2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l) (1.16)

In simple language we can say that when two or more substances
(elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions
are called combination reactions.

In Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved.
This makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is
released along with the formation of products are called exothermic
chemical reactions.

Other examples of exothermic reactions are –

(i) Burning of natural gas
    CH4(g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g) (1.17)

(ii) Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?

We all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy
from the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler
substances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain
carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.
This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides
energy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of
which you will study in Chapter 6.

C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(aq) → 6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy (1.18)
(Glucose)

(iii) The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an
     example of an exothermic reaction.

Identify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where
heat is given out along with the formation of a single product.

**Do You Know?**

A solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction 1.13 is used for whitewashing
walls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin
layer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is formed after two to
three days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note
that the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.

Ca(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) → CaCO3(s) + H2O(l) (1.14)
(Calcium        (Calcium
hydroxide)      carbonate)

## Activity 1.5

- Take about 2 g ferrous sulphate crystals
in a dry boiling tube.
- Note the colour of the ferrous sulphate
crystals.
- Heat the boiling tube over the flame
of a


2Pb(NO3)2(s) → 2PbO(s) + 4NO2(g) + O2(g) (1.20)
(Lead nitrate)    (Lead oxide)

In this reaction, lead nitrate on heating breaks down to lead oxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen. Here also, you can observe that a single reactant breaks down to give simpler products.

## Activity 1.7

- Take some zinc dust in a conical flask and add dilute hydrochloric acid.
- Immediately cover the mouth of the conical flask with a gas jar as shown in Fig. 1.6.
- Keep the flask undisturbed for some time.
- Now bring a burning candle near the mouth of the gas jar and observe.

The gas burns with a 'pop' sound. This is due to the presence of hydrogen gas.

Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g) (1.21)

In this reaction, zinc reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce zinc chloride and hydrogen gas. Can you name the type of reaction taking place here?

In this reaction, a compound breaks down in the presence of another substance to give simpler products. This type of reaction is known as displacement reaction.

Other examples of displacement reactions are:

(i) Reaction of metal with water
    2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) (1.22)

(ii) Reaction of metal with salt solution
    Cu(s) + 2AgNO3(aq) → Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2Ag(s) (1.23)

### 1.2.2 Decomposition Reaction

A decomposition reaction is opposite to a combination reaction. In a decomposition reaction, a single compound breaks down to give two or more simpler substances. Let us discuss some examples of decomposition reactions.

(i) Decomposition of ferrous sulphate
    (See Activity 1.5)

(ii) Decomposition of calcium carbonate
    CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g) (1.24)
    (Limestone)   (Quick lime)

(iii) Decomposition of lead nitrate
    (See Activity 1.6)

(iv) Decomposition of silver chloride
    2AgCl(s) → 2Ag(s) + Cl2(g) (1.25)

### 1.2.3 Displacement Reaction

In a displacement reaction, a more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound. Both metals and non-metals take part in displacement reactions.

(i) Metal displacement
    Fe(s) + CuSO4(aq) → FeSO4(aq) + Cu(s) (1.26)

(ii) Non-metal displacement
    Cl2(g) + 2NaI(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + I2(s) (1.27)

### 1.2.4 Double Displacement Reaction

Double displacement reactions are those reactions in which exchange of ions between two reactants takes place to form two products.

For example:
Na2SO4(aq) + BaCl2(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq) (1.28)

In this reaction, sodium sulphate solution reacts with barium chloride solution to give a white precipitate of barium sulphate and a solution of sodium chloride.

### 1.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction

Oxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen. Reduction is the loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen.

For example:
2Cu + O2 → 2CuO (1.29)
(Oxidation of copper)

CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O (1.30)
(Reduction of copper oxide)

In reaction (1.29), copper is oxidised to copper oxide and in reaction (1.30), copper oxide is reduced to copper.

## 1.3 HAVE YOU OBSERVED THE EFFECTS OF OXIDATION REACTIONS IN EVERYDAY LIFE?

### 1.3.1 Corrosion

Corrosion is the process through which metals are eaten up gradually by the action of air, moisture or a chemical (such as an acid) on their surface.

For example, corrosion of iron to form rust:
4Fe + 3O2 + 2H2O → 4Fe(OH)3 (1.31)
(Rust)

### 1.3.2 Rancidity

Rancidity is the process of oxidation of fats and oils that causes them to develop an unpleasant smell and taste.

## Questions

1. Why does the colour of copper sulphate solution change when an iron nail is dipped in it?

2. Give an example of a double displacement reaction other than the one given in Activity 1.10.

3. Identify the substances that are oxidised and the substances that are reduced in the following reactions.
   (i) 4Na(s) + O2(g) → 2Na2O(s)
   (ii) CuO(s) + H2(g) → Cu(s) + H2O(l)
